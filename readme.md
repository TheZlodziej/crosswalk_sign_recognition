# Problem description
## Goal
Determine whether input image(s) are of crosswalk sign
## Justification
Chose this because the previous year couldn't manage and needed to see if what they were saying was true (it wasn't). Also, Chat GPT suggested CNN, thus I chose this approach ðŸ«¡.
## Input
Cropped images of traffic signs to be determined as traffic sign (detection not implemented!!!)
## AI Field
Deep learning, neural network (convolutional neural network)

# Description of chosen concept (CNN)
## CNN description
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning neural network that is typically used for image and video processing tasks. It is composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for detecting features in the input data, such as edges and shapes, while the pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the data to make it more manageable. The fully connected layers are used to classify the features detected by the convolutional layers.

## Data needed
Large set of labeled images that represent different traffic sign (including crosswalk sign)

## Description of my solution
This solution consists of 2 main stages first - training and saving the model, second loading the model and input images and specifing output for every single one of them.

1. Building the model.
   1. Load images, preprocess them and split into train, test and validation sets.
   2. Make the model using sequential group of linear stack of layers, and compile it.
   3. Train the model with train dataset and validate it with validation dataset.
   4. Calculate loss and accuracy using test dataset.
   5. Save the model.
2. Classification of input images.
   1. Load the model.
   2. Load all the images to be classified.
   3. Preprocess loaded images.
   4. Predict images' labels.
   5. For every image check if it was predicted as crosswalk sign.
   6. Print the output.

## Output
As the output, {image path} - {result} will be printed in console for each input image

## Problems with this solution
- Image that is not a traffic sign might be interpreted as one if it looks similar (the program will try to find best fitting solution).
- Input image has to be cropped and of traffic sign to be correctly classified.
- Large dataset is needed for model training -> my dataset wasn't that large, thus it might not work sometimes.
- It takes a lot of time to train the model.
