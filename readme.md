## Problem description
#### Goal
- Determine whether input image(s) are of crosswalk sign
#### Justification
- Chose this because the previous year couldn't manage and needed to see if what they were saying was true (it wasn't)
#### Input
- Cropped images of traffic signs to be determined as traffic sign (detection not implemented!!!)
#### AI Field
- Deep learning neural network (convolutional neural network)

| KNN                  | Easy to implement and understand, Good performance on small datasets | Poor performance on large datasets, high computational cost, poor interpretability (decisions made) |

# Description of chosen concept (CNN)
#### CNN description
TODO

#### Data needed
- Large set of labeled images that represent different traffic sign (including crosswalk sign)

#### Output
- As the output, {image path} - {result} will be printed in console for each input image


#### Problems with this solution
